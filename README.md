# fBSM-calibration

Exploring and comparing calibration techniques of fractional Black Scholes Model

1. Python scripts in the Code directory modularise various steps in training and modelling.
> PricerWithNoPenalty, PricerWithPenalty and InverseMap are the gateway scripts <br>
> Other scripts are utility functions for various steps involved 

2. Experiments folder houses 2 ipython notebooks using components formally explained in Code directory
> NN.ipynb shows the experiments done for Pricers and Inverse Map <br>
> Modelling.ipynb shows the baseline estimations for model parameters and checking with market data

3. Pictures directory shows the various images pertaining to implementation used in the Project reports.

4. TrainingLogs directory has the logs of training and validation errors in each epochs.
