# fBSM-calibration

Exploring and comparing calibration techniques of fractional Black Scholes Model

1. Python scripts in the Code directory modularise various steps in training and modelling.
> PricerWithNoPenalty, PricerWithPenalty and InverseMap are the gateway scripts
> Other scripts are utility functions for various steps involved 

2. Experiments folder houses 2 ipython notebooks using components formally explained in Code
> NN.ipynb shows the experiments done for Pricers and Inverse Map
> Modelling.ipynb shows the baseline estimations for model parameters and checking with market data

3. Pictures directory shows the various images pertaining to implementation used in the Project reports.
